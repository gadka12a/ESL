# ESL
Tutorials for ESL 

The repository was created to perform credit tutorials on ESL.

Each tutorial has its own catalog which includes:

- Python script to generate the code
- generated verilog file
- implementation with generated bitstream

We had have problems with tutorial "Hierarchy and Abstraction and Ursidae, Oh My!".
But after changing a part of of the line:

change assign k_chunk_insts_0_chunk_insts_6_chunk_insts_0_a[0] = Nope;

to:

assign k_chunk_insts_0_chunk_insts_6_chunk_insts_0_a[0] = 0;

we managed to complete this task.
